Because sometimes the best way to learn its by practicing and because most of the courses teach you the just the basics and give you a todo app, I wanted to create something different. We will create Three real life projects,  so we can practice our react coding in a more real environment.

If you don’t know much of React, no worries. We will start simple with a static landing page , then we will go to a much more compete project with authentication and DB and last but not least we will create am e-commerce style project with user cart, PayPal, not only that we will create our own server to handle all the requests.

If you know nothing about React, don’t worry, I added a bonus section with a tiny React course so you can understand the basics and how react works. So you can start from there and then go to the practice projects.



To sum everything up, this what we will be creating in this course:



Project one ”The venue”:

How to create a project with React CLI

Creation of components

Using third party libraries

Creating transitions on reveal and carrousel.

Using parts of Material UI to make our app better.

Deployment of a static webpages to SURGE.



Project two “M City”:

More complex animations and transitions

Rendering components using data from a server

We wi
